  -ESP32 IR People Counter-

A simple embedded systems project using an ESP32, IR break-beam sensors, and I2C/SPI communication to detect and count people passing through a doorway.

Features:

ESP32 programmed in Arduino/C++

IR sensors for beam-break detection

Non-blocking timing logic

Debouncing and noise filtering

I2C/SPI usage from microcontroller coursework

Serial monitor output for debugging

Breadboard prototype + soldered connections

What This Project Demonstrates

This project shows my practical experience in:

Embedded programming (ESP32, Arduino, AVR)

Sensor interfaces (I2C, SPI, digital I/O)

Hardware debugging

Electronics prototyping

Soldering

Simple system design and testing

Wiring Diagram

(Add image here, even a hand-drawn one or Fritzing diagram is fine.)

Photos

(Add: breadboard, ESP32, IR sensors, prototype pictures.)

Code

Add your main.cpp or Arduino .ino file in the /code folder.
